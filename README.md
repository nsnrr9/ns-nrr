## Quick Information
Good day to anyone seeing this, I am Nethra-- you might see me around with a pseudo-name nsnrr, sleeping0rca or Nyra but thats all me lol. I've been working on multiple fields in and itself of Computer Science. I got first interested in HTML because of neocities and myspace, then I transitioned to C# due to Unity, and shortly to Lua. I sort of just started liking the idea of what I was doing and took up some Networking courses like CompTIA and figured I like network based applications much better...soon in 2021 I got interested in ML and its potency. Naturally, I was intersted in theoritical ML and decided I would like to research further and develop algorithms for an optimised experience in ML itself.

- I am a `17` year old female. `(I'm NOT a dude. Pls, oh my god)`
- ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒŠ I have an obession towards ecological matters such as the ocean and forests.
- Sharkarcheology & Whale evolution enthusiast.
- I'm currently learning `C++` & `Rust`
