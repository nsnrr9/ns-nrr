<!-- Welcome to my readme source you stalker. Anyway so, I decided to work on this rather than actually uploading any repositories. Thy shall witness git servers falling apart when I do though. I'm just wayy too busy working on conference papers at the moment so no projects as of now :(-->

## Quick Information
I am Nethra S I go by nsnrr9 online. I am a programmer & I do a lot of other things other than that as well. 

Not a lot of repositories have been published, thats majorly because I've been working on conference papers rather than working on actual projects and its getting me so mad right now but however there are a few projects I'm actively working on right now. Super cool stuff!

also, ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒŠ I have an obession towards ecological matters such as the ocean and forests, and so I go above and beyond working on projects with regards to these.
